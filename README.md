# Actor - Loopnet Scraper

## Loopnet scraper

Since Loopnet doesn't provide a good and free API, this actor should help you to retrieve data from it.

The Loopnet data scraper supports the following features:

-   Search any search results - Get any search results even if it is an auction, lease, sale, or business.

-   Scrape lists by cities or regions - Retrieve data by cities, regions, or countries from Loopnet.

-   Scrape businesses for sale - Looking for businesses for sale? No worries. You can check any businesses for sale with the latest information in a blazing fast time!

-   Scrape any business or property details - Get details of properties or businesses such as location, contact information,  zones, taxes, detailed information, and many more! Just type the URL of it.

## Bugs, fixes, updates, and changelog

This scraper is under active development. If you have any feature requests you can create an issue from [here](https://github.com/epctex/loopnet-scraper/issues).


## Input Parameters

The input of this scraper should be JSON containing the list of pages on Loopnet that should be visited. Possible fields are:

- `startUrls`: (Required) (Array) List of LoopNet URLs. It should be search, list, business search, business detail, or property detail URL.

- `endPage`: (Optional) (Number) Final number of page that you want to scrape. The default is `Infinite`. This applies to all `search` requests and `startUrls` individually.

- `maxItems`: (Optional) (Number) You can limit scraped items. This should be useful when you search through the big lists or search results.

- `proxy`: (Required) (Proxy Object) Proxy configuration.

- `extendOutputFunction`: (Optional) (String) Function that takes a JQuery handle ($) as an argument and returns an object with data.

- `customMapFunction`: (Optional) (String) Function that takes each object's handle as an argument and returns the object with executing the function.

This solution requires the use of **Proxy servers**, either your own proxy servers or you can use [Apify Proxy](https://www.apify.com/docs/proxy).

### Tip

When you want to scrape over a specific listing URL, just copy and paste the link as one of the **startUrl**.

If you would like to scrape only the first page of a list then put the link for the page and have the `endPage` as 1.

With the last approach that is explained above you can also fetch any interval of pages. If you provide the 5th page of a list and define the `endPage` parameter as 6 then you'll have the 5th and 6th pages only.

### Compute Unit Consumption

The actor is optimized to run blazing fast and scrape many listings as possible. Therefore, it forefronts all listing detail requests. If the actor doesn't block very often it'll scrape 100 listings in 2 minutes with ~0.04-0.8 compute units.

### Loopnet Scraper Input example

```json
{
  "startUrls":[
    "https://www.loopnet.com/biz/new-york-businesses-for-sale/",
    "https://www.loopnet.com/biz/Business-Opportunity/six-figure-income-selling-raising-champion-ragdoll-kittens/2048785/",
    "https://www.loopnet.com/search/office-buildings/usa/for-sale/?sk=c6f67af77ac46e004033dd553ebc1429&e=u",
    "https://www.loopnet.com/Listing/701-Technology-Dr-Canonsburg-PA/27506067/",
    "https://www.loopnet.com/Listing/825-Third-Ave-New-York-NY/13877304/",
    "https://www.loopnet.com/Listing/240-Riverside-Blvd-New-York-NY/17114174/"
  ],
  "endPage":1,
  "maxItems":10,
  "proxy":{
    "useApifyProxy":true
  }
}

```

## During the Run

During the run, the actor will output messages letting you know what is going on. Each message always contains a short label specifying which page from the provided list is currently specified.
When items are loaded from the page, you should see a message about this event with a loaded item count and total item count for each page.

If you provide incorrect input to the actor, it will immediately stop with a failure state and output an explanation of what is wrong.

## Loopnet Export

During the run, the actor stores results into a dataset. Each item is a separate item in the dataset.

You can manage the results in any language (Python, PHP, Node JS/NPM). See the FAQ or <a href="https://www.apify.com/docs/api" target="blank">our API reference</a> to learn more about getting results from this Loopnet actor.

## Scraped Loopnet Output

The structure of each item in Loopnet looks like this:
